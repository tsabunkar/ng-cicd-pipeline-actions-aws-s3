---

# Technologies to be used

- Angular-Material
- C.I -> Github Actions and Protected Branch rules (To restrict on build failure)
- C.D -> Deploy in AWS
- Host : Godaddy url -> https://tsabunkar.in

# Rules added to protect Portfolio Repo:

- Github Actions added which will check the build process only. It will not restrict the push/PR if the build fails.
- In order to prevent the direct push to master branch and also verify PR to master must pass all C.I build process:
  - github hooks are added locally go to press CTRL + H (toggle hide/unhide) -> .git/hooks/ [create the copy of pre-push.sample file called: pre-push (removing .sample extension) then add the script https://gist.github.com/tsabunkar/86224fb8240afd46529b82b5bcb4f100 ]
  - Branch Protection Rule Added: Protect matching branches rule added for Master branch like:
    - Require pull request reviews before merging (this will prevent contributor who don't have admin/owner privilege cannot directly push to master branch)
    - Require status checks to pass before merging (this will ensure All build process in C.I is passed before enabling merging PR button ).

- Since we can break above local git hooks -> Using the flag --no-verify wonâ€™t trigger hooks.
- Also we cannot go to each user and ask them to configure/add git hooks folder, rather to automate this process :
  - \$ mkdir .githooks
  - \$ ls -a .git/hooks/ | grep -v ".sample" (find all the files which doesn't have .sample extension)
  - (Copy all your hooks file from .git/hooks to .githooks)
  - \$ git config core.hooksPath .githooks/ (change the hooks folder to githooks instead of .git/hooks)
  - git hooks are written in shell scripts (but for node u can use husky-> act as wrapper over shell scripts)
  - push this .githooks to your remote repo
  - Onces the developer takes the latest pull of your remote repo- ask them to execute this commands : git config core.hooksPath .githooks/
